            <p>My first project was an assignment to make a robot which makes a specific persons life easier. One of our group member had a condition where he needs to have regular sugar intake. So we designed this robot incase the person in question needs his regular sugar intake and thus this machine would dispense a single bar of DEXTRO.</p>
