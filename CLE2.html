            <p>In our second semester of school we had the task of creating a dyncamic reservation website for a client. My client was a shooting range called S.V. Doeltreffend. Their shooting range is located in Delfse hout. I primarerly focused on creating a reservation on which gun you would use on the shooting range. If you visit the website, you are asked to login, since we wouldnt want people that arent a member of the shooting range to make reservations. After you are logged in you are sent to the home page where you can make a choice on which gun you would like to use. There is a selection of 8 guns from which you can choose. After that you can choose the date, which position you would do it in and which lane you wanted to use. On the more technical side, This is the first time i made a website using Object Orientated Programming. We had a class called Advanced Programming which would cover this subject, but this clas wasnt required to take. I took to to myself to challenge myself and try this Object Orientated Programming.</Prog></p>
